ITPAL provides efficient implementations for KL-divergence based projections of Gaussians. This package focuses specifically on the projection operations, optimized through C++ and parallelized using OpenMP and provides low level bindings for them. 

Implementations for [PyTorch](https://github.com/ALRhub/ITPAL) and [JAX](https://github.com/ALRhub/ITPAL_JAX) are available.
