I'm a PhD student in the ALR group at KIT, supervised by Prof. Gerhard Neumann.
I started my PhD at the Bosch Center for Artificial Intelligence (BCAI) in January 2020, jointly supervised by Dr. Andras Kupcsik and Prof. Neumann before moving to KIT in April 2023.
My background includes Bachelor's and Master's degrees in Electrical Engineering and Computing from the University of Belgrade, and previous work on socially assistive robotics at the Institute of Robotics and Industrial Informatics in Barcelona, Spain.
My research is focused on robot learning from human feedback.
