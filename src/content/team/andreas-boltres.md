I have obtained my Bachelor’s and Master’s degree in Computer Science from the KIT in 2017 and 2021 respectively, with a focus on Machine Learning, Robotics and Physics.
After a brief job detour in 2021 I am very happy to be working with the wonderful people at ALR again as an external PhD student, starting from May 2022.
My research focuses on Telemetry-Aware Routing Optimization in Computer Networks using Reinforcement/Imitation Learning and Graph Neural Networks.
