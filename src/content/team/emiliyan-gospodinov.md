I started my PhD at the Autonomous Learning Robots (ALR) group in April 2025 at KIT, under the supervision of [Prof. Gerhard Neumann](/team/geri).
Previously, I completed my Bachelor's and Master's degrees in Computer Science at KIT.

My main research focus is Reinforcement Learning, with a current emphasis on Vision-Language-Action models.
