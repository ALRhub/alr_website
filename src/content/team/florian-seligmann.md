I started my PhD at the Autonomous Learning Robot (ALR) group in November 2025 at KIT, under the supervision of Prof. Gerhard Neumann.
Before that, I completed my Bachelor's and Master's at KIT, both majoring in Computer Science.

I primarily work on **Vision-Language-Action models**, focusing on **interactive learning** and **in-context-learning**.
More generally, I am interested in robust **Imitation Learning** and **Uncertainty Quantification**.
