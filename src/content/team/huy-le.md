I am an off-campus PhD student at the Bosch Center for Artificial Intelligence, having joined the ALR group in April 2024 under the supervision of [Prof. Gerhard Neumann](/team/geri). I completed my Master’s degree at the Technical University of Dortmund.

My research focuses on scaling robot learning for complex tasks. Specifically, I work on **Robot Manipulation**, **Diffusion Policies**, and **Massively Parallel Reinforcement Learning**.
