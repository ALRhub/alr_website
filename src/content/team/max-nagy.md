I joined the Lab in 2025. My research interests are algorithms for robust and deployable RL with a focus on sample efficiency and the incorporation of demonstration data.
As part of the [XSCAVE](https://xscave.eu/) project, I work on automating Excavation and Forestry in tasks with complex kinematics, limited observations and contact-rich interactions.
