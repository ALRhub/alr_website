I started at the ALR Lab as a student assistant, then did my master thesis there and finally joined in 2021 as a PhD student.
Before starting as PhD student, I did my Bachelor's and Master's at KIT in Karlsruhe.
Meanwhile I held several working student positions from embedded development over general web development to robot related web development.
My research interest covers various fields of Robotics, Robot Vision, and Sensor Processing.
As main research topic, however, I focus on Imitation Learning, in particular Inverse Reinforcement Learning.
I meanwhile work on Robot Teleoperation and Augmented Reality, hoping to utilize these fields together.
