I graduated in October 2025 and am currently working as a postdoctoral researcher, 
focusing on reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms.

I started my PhD at the University of Tübingen in July 2019 and joined the Autonomous Learning Robot group 
in early 2020, where I continued my doctoral research.
My research revolves around reinforcement learning and its applications to robotics. 
I am particularly interested in developing RL algorithms for expressive policies, such as diffusion-based policies. 
These types of policies are often challenging to optimize and require tailored training approaches.
More generally, I’m interested in making RL methods more sample-efficient so they can be applied more effectively 
to real robotic systems.

Before my PhD, I completed my Bachelor’s and Master’s degrees in Electrical Engineering and 
Information Technology at Technische Universität Darmstadt.
