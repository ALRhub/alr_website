I started my PhD at the University of Tübingen in July 2019. At the begining of 2020, I joined the Autonomous Learning Robot group to continue my PhD. My research interests include reinforcement learning and optimal control in robotics. More specific, I am interested in developing algorithms to let the robot learn versatile behaviors by using methods from hierarchical reinforcement learning and variational inference.

Before I started my PhD I received a Bachelor's degree and Master's degree in Electrical Engineering and Information Technology at the Technische Universität Darmstadt.
