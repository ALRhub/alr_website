I am a PhD student in the Autonomous Learning Robots (ALR) under Prof. Gerhard Neumann at the Institute of Anthropomatics and Robotics (IAR) at the KIT.
I finished my Bachelor in Mathematics at the University of Heidelberg in 2018.
After a change of study subject, I completed my Master in Computer Science at the KIT in 2021.
During my Master, I worked at the ALR as a HiWi and wrote my Master Thesis about deep learning Optimization here.
In October 2021, I started my PhD.
My research focuses on the one side on Optimization in deep learning with high-dimensional objectives and on the other side on human/robot interaction.
