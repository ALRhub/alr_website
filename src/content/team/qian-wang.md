I began my PhD in September 2025 at the Autonomous Learning Robots (ALR) lab, where I am supervised by Prof. Gerhard Neumann. Before that, I received my Master’s degree in Mechatronics and Information Technology from the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology, and my Bachelor’s degree in Mechanical Engineering from the Beijing Institute of Technology. Currently, my research focuses on multi-modal imitation learning, vision foundation models, and vision-language-action models (VLAs).
