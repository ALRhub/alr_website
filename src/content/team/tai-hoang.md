I started my PhD at the Autonomous Learning Robot (ALR) group in June 2023 at KIT, under the supervision of [Prof. Gerhard Neumann](/team/geri). Before that, I completed my Master at the Technical University of Munich and my Bachelor at the University of Information Technology in Vietnam, both majoring in Computer Science.

My research interest includes: *Graph Neural Networks*, *Physical Modelling*, *Reinforcement Learning*, and *Deformable Object Manipulation*.
