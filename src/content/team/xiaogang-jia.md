I started my PhD at ALR in October 2022. Before that, I worked as a research intern at Shanghai Artificial Intelligence Lab. I got my Master's Degree in Control Engineering at Harbin Institute of Technology and my Bachelor's Degree in Automation at Harbin Engineering University. My research interests include imitation learning and offline reinforcement learning. Currently I am focusing on the research of multi-modal robot learning.
